Characterization of influenza virus variants induced by treatment with the endonuclease inhibitor baloxavir marboxil. Baloxavir Marboxil for Uncomplicated Influenza in Adults and Adolescents. BACKGROUND: Baloxavir marboxil is a selective inhibitor of influenza cap-dependent endonuclease. It has shown therapeutic activity in preclinical models of influenza A and B virus infections, including strains resistant to current antiviral agents. CONCLUSIONS: Single-dose baloxavir was without evident safety concerns, was superior to placebo in alleviating influenza symptoms, and was superior to both oseltamivir and placebo in reducing the viral load 1 day after initiation of the trial regimen in patients with uncomplicated influenza. A single oral dose of baloxavir is usually well tolerated; it hastens alleviation of influenza symptoms and shortens the duration of viral shedding.

Whole-genome duplicates tend to exhibit less profound phenotypic effects when deleted, are functionally less divergent, and are associated with a different set of functions than their small-scale duplicate counterparts. The results uncover the WGD as a major source for the evolution of a complex interconnected block of transcriptional pathways. These selected pairs, both WGD and SSD, tend to have decelerated functional evolution, have higher propensities of co-clustering into the same protein complexes, and share common interacting partners. Moreover, we find additional transcriptional profiles that are suggestive of neo- and subfunctionalization of duplicate gene copies.

Conclusions: Tecovirimat treatment initiated up to 8 days following a lethal aerosol MPXV challenge improves survival and, when initiated earlier than 5 days after challenge, provides protection from clinical effects of disease, supporting the conclusion that it is a promising smallpox antiviral therapeutic candidate. Tecovirimat: First Global Approval. In July 2018, oral tecovirimat was approved in the USA for the treatment of human smallpox disease caused by variola virus in adults and paediatric patients weighing \u2265\u00a013\u00a0kg. An intravenous formulation of tecovirimat is undergoing phase I development for the treatment of smallpox infection.

METHODS: An electronic literature search was performed of public databases (MEDLINE, Excerpta Medica dataBASE [EMBASE], and Cochrane) and conference proceedings for trials using PD-1 inhibitors (nivolumab and pembrolizumab) and PD-L1 inhibitors (atezolizumab, durvalumab, and avelumab) in patients with NSCLC. Durvalumab in non-small-cell lung cancer patients: current developments. Single-agent durvalumab showed clinical efficacy and a manageable safety profile in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer, particularly the \u226525% PD-L1+ population. Six drugs including one CTLA-4 blocker (ipilimumab), two PD-1 blockers (nivolumab and pembrolizumab) and three PD-L1 blockers (atezolizumab, avelumab and durvalumab) are approved for the treatment of different types of cancers including both solid tumors such as melanoma, lung cancer, head and neck cancer, bladder cancer and Merkel cell cancer as well as hematological tumors such as classic Hodgkin's lymphoma.  PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The therapeutic armamentarium for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer has evolved considerably over the past years. Immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting programmed cell death-1 such as pembrolizumab and nivolumab or programmed cell death ligand 1 such as atezolizumab, durvalumab and avelumab have shown favorable efficacy results in this patient population in the first-line and second-line setting. In addition, preclinical and early clinical evidence suggests that chemotherapy and radiation may work synergistically with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy to promote antitumor immunity, which has led to the initiation of clinical trials testing these drugs in patients with stage III NSCLC. A preliminary report of a randomized phase III trial, the PACIFIC trial, demonstrated an impressive increase in median progression-free survival with consolidative durvalumab, a PD-L1 inhibitor, compared with observation after cCRT.  ICI, such as the PD-1 inhibitors nivolumab and pembrolizumab and the PD-L1 inhibitor atezolizumab, have already been marketed for the treatment of pretreated patients with advanced NSCLC.

On the other end of the weight distribution, indigenous children who are severely thin or thin have significantly lower cognitive scores, a relationship that holds after correcting for possible bias and appears to strengthen between ages of five and eight. Obesity is associated with decreased cognitive function, reduced gray matter volume, and impaired white matter integrity in cognition-related brain areas in patients with MDD. The data suggest that being overweight or obese in midlife may be more detrimental to subsequent age-related cognitive decline than being overweight or obese at later stages of the life span Poor cognitive performance was present in 37% of the sample. General obesity (BMI>or = 25) and poor cognition were strongly associated in the presence of abdominal obesity. Poor cognition was negatively associated with overweight (BMI 23-25) with normal waist circumference. BMI could be used as a candidate risk marker to identify people at higher risk of cognitive deficits, and as an intervention target for modifications of cognitive outcomes. Obesity is a common medical illness that is increasingly recognised as conferring risk of decline in cognitive performance, independent of other comorbid medical conditions. Overweight and obesity are associated with an increased risk of subnormal intellectual performance in young adult males. Subjects with low birth weight and adolescent overweight/obesity are at particular risk of subnormal performance. Impairments in cognitive function have been associated with obesity in both people and rodents. Obesity in the pre-school years was associated with poorer outcomes for some cognitive measures in this study. Stronger relationships between obesity and cognition or educational attainment may emerge later in childhood. There is parallel evidence that people who are overweight or obese tend to perform worse on a variety of cognitive tasks While research in this area is growing, our knowledge of obesity-related cognitive dysfunction and brain alterations has not yet been synthesized. The present review integrates the recent literature regarding patterns of obesity-related cognitive dysfunction and brain alterations and also indicates potential mechanisms for these neuropathological changes. The review culminates in a preliminary model of obesity-related cognitive dysfunction and suggestions for future research, including the potential reversibility of these changes with weight-loss.<br> Evidence for the increased prevalence of diabetes and obesity is reviewed as it relates to cognitive decline.

More recently, promising outcomes have also been reported with new agents, such as nivolumab and cabozantinib.  Positive results in recent phase III clinical trials have confirmed the high value of anti-angiogenic therapies for HCC in both first (sorafenib and lenvatinib) and second line (regorafenib and cabozantinib) treatment modalities.  Expert opinion: Based on favorable phase III clinical trial data, sorafenib and lenvatinib are considered promising agents for HCC as first-line systemic chemotherapy. Moreover, regorafenib and cabozantinib are useful second-line therapies after the failure of sorafenib. Cabozantinib in Patients with Advanced and Progressing Hepatocellular Carcinoma. BACKGROUND: Cabozantinib inhibits tyrosine kinases, including vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 1, 2, and 3, MET, and AXL, which are implicated in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma and the development of resistance to sorafenib, the standard initial treatment for advanced disease.  Median overall survival was 10.2 months with cabozantinib and 8.0 months with placebo (hazard ratio for death, 0.76; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.63 to 0.92; P=0.005).

CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with previously treated advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, treatment with cabozantinib resulted in longer overall survival and progression-free survival than placebo.  Positive phase III-study data have been published for lenvatinib as first-line and cabozantinib as second-line therapy.

CGRP receptor antagonists such as ubrogepant are effective for acute relief of migraine headache, whereas monoclonal antibodies against CGRP (eptinezumab, fremanezumab and galcanezumab) or the CGRP receptor (erenumab) effectively prevent migraine attacks.  Four monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting the CGRP pathway are currently under evaluation for the prevention of episodic and chronic migraine: eptinezumab (ALD403), fremanezumab (TEV-48125), galcanezumab (LY2951742), and erenumab (AMG334).  Introduction Galcanezumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody binding calcitonin gene-related peptide, used for migraine prevention. Efficacy and safety of galcanezumab for the prevention of episodic migraine: Results of the EVOLVE-2 Phase 3 randomized controlled clinical trial. Galcanezumab induced a robust, dose-dependent, and durable inhibition of capsaicin-induced increase in DBF, supporting the continued clinical development of galcanezumab for prophylaxis in migraine patients. The efficacy and safety of calcitonin gene-related peptide monoclonal antibody for episodic migraine: a meta-analysis.Based on the results of this meta-analysis, CGRP monoclonal antibodies significantly reduced the monthly migraine days and acute migraine-specific medication.  Importance Galcanezumab (LY2951742), a monoclonal antibody against calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), is one of a novel class of new medicines for migraine prevention. Galcanezumab appears efficacious, safe, and well tolerated for the preventive treatment of chronic migraine. BACKGROUND Galcanezumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and has demonstrated efficacy in reducing migraine headache days (MHD) in patients with episodic and chronic migraine. BACKGROUND Galcanezumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to the calcitonin gene-related peptide, has demonstrated in previous Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical studies (\u22646-month of treatment) a reduction in the number of migraine headache days and improved patients' functioning. CONCLUSION Twelve months of treatment with self-administered injections of galcanezumab was safe and associated with a reduction in the number of monthly migraine headache days.

More recently, promising outcomes have also been reported with new agents, such as nivolumab and cabozantinib. Positive results in recent phase III clinical trials have confirmed the high value of anti-angiogenic therapies for HCC in both first (sorafenib and lenvatinib) and second line (regorafenib and cabozantinib) treatment modalities.  More recently, regorafenib and nivolumab have received approval in the second-line setting after sorafenib, with further positive phase 3 studies emerging in the first line (lenvatinib non-inferior to sorafenib) and second line versus placebo (cabozantinib and ramucirumab).  The rapidly changing treatment landscape due to the emergence of new treatment options (sorafenib and lenvatinib equally effective in first line; regorafenib, cabozantinib, and ramucirumab showing OS benefit in second line with nivolumab approved by the FDA based on response rate) underscores the importance of re-assessing the role of the first approved systemic agent in HCC, sorafenib.

Using massively parallel sequencing we identified 13 patients bearing heterozygous germline alterations in BCL11B.

Six frameshift mutations, two nonsense mutations, one missense mutation, and two chromosomal rearrangements resulting in diminished BCL11B expression, arose de novo. A further frameshift mutation was transmitted from a similarly affected mother. Interestingly, the most severely affected patient harbours a missense mutation within a zinc-finger domain of BCL11B, probably affecting the DNA-binding structural interface, similar to the recently published patient. Furthermore, the most C-terminally located premature termination codon mutation fails to rescue the progenitor cell proliferation defect in hippocampal slice cultures from Bcl11b-deficient mice. Concerning the role of BCL11B in the immune system, extensive immune phenotyping of our patients revealed alterations in the T cell compartment and lack of peripheral type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s), consistent with the findings described in Bcl11b-deficient mice. Unsupervised analysis of 102 T lymphocyte subpopulations showed that the patients clearly cluster apart from healthy children, further supporting the common aetiology of the disorder.

Lasmiditan for the treatment of acute migraine: a review and potential role in clinical practice.  BACKGROUND Lasmiditan (COL-144) is a novel, centrally acting, highly selective 5-HT(1F) receptor agonist without vasoconstrictor activity that seemed effective when given as an intravenous infusion in a proof-of-concept migraine study. INTERPRETATION Oral lasmiditan seems to be safe and effective in the acute treatment of migraine. The 5-HT1F receptor agonist lasmiditan, a drug acting through non-vasoconstrictive mechanisms, represents a promising safe, effective and tolerated acute migraine therapy also for patients at cardiovascular risk. For the understanding of migraine pathophysiology, it is very important to note that a selective 5-HT(1F) receptor agonist like lasmiditan is effective in the acute treatment of migraine. The 5-HT1F receptor agonist lasmiditan as a potential treatment of migraine attacks: a review of two placebo-controlled phase II trials. Within the past few years, new and promising drugs such as more specific 5-HT 1F receptor agonists (that is, lasmiditan) and monoclonal calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antibodies entered advanced development phases while non-invasive neuromodulatory approaches were suggested to be potentially effective as non-pharmaceutical interventions for migraine.

In a recent work (Tsochatzidou et al., Nucleic Acids Res 45:5818-5828, 2017), we proposed the existence of a functional compartmentalization of the yeast genome according to which, genes occupying the chromosomal regions at the nuclear periphery have distinct structural, functional and evolutionary characteristics compared to their centromeric-proximal counterparts. Around the same time, it was also shown that the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is organized in topologically associated domains (TADs), which are largely associated with the replication timing. Form and function of topologically associating genomic domains in budding yeast. Although similar structures appear to be conserved in fission yeast, computational modeling and analysis of high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) data have been used to argue that the small, highly constrained budding yeast chromosomes could not have these structures. In contrast, herein we analyze Hi-C data for budding yeast and identify 200-kb scale TADs, whose boundaries are enriched for transcriptional activity. Furthermore, these boundaries separate regions of similarly timed replication origins connecting the long-known effect of genomic context on replication timing to genome architecture. To investigate the molecular basis of TAD formation, we performed Hi-C experiments on cells depleted for the Forkhead transcription factors, Fkh1 and Fkh2, previously associated with replication timing. Forkhead factors do not regulate TAD formation, but do promote longer-range genomic interactions and control interactions between origins near the centromere. Thus, our work defines spatial organization within the budding yeast nucleus, demonstrates the conserved role of genome architecture in regulating DNA replication, and identifies a molecular mechanism specifically regulating interactions between pericentric origins.

The Miller-Dieker syndrome (MDS), a rare congenital disorder manifested by characteristic facial abnormalities and lissencephaly (smooth brain), is associated with microdeletions of the distal 17p region. Miller-Dieker syndrome (MDS), a disorder manifesting the severe brain malformation lissencephaly (\"smooth brain\"), is caused, in the majority of cases, by a chromosomal microdeletion of the distal short arm of chromosome 17. The Miller-Dieker syndrome (MDS), composed of characteristic facial abnormalities and a severe neuronal migration disorder affecting the cerebral cortex, is caused by visible or submicroscopic deletions of chromosome band 17p13.

The Miller-Dieker syndrome, a disorder of neuronal migration, is caused by deletions of chromosome 17p13.3. The girl was diagnosed by subtelomeric FISH and array-CGH, showing a 4.43-Mb heterozygous deletion on chromosome 10p that involved 14 genes and a 3.22-Mb single-copy gain on chromosome 17p, which includes the critical region of the Miller-Dieker syndrome and 61 genes. Detection of submicroscopic deletions in band 17p13 in patients with the Miller-Dieker syndrome.The Miller-Dieker syndrome (MDS), a syndrome with lissencephaly, distinctive craniofacial features, growth impairment, and profound developmental failure, has been associated with a deletion of the distal part of chromosome band 17p13.  Microdeletions including YWHAE in the Miller-Dieker syndrome region on chromosome 17p13.3 result in facial dysmorphisms, growth restriction, and cognitive impairment.Microdeletions of chromosome 17p13.3 involving YWHAE present with growth restriction, craniofacial dysmorphisms, structural abnormalities of brain and cognitive impairment.  Unbalanced translocation (15;17)(q13;13.3) with apparent Prader-Willi syndrome but without Miller-Dieker syndrome.We studied after death a 3-month-old girl whose karyotype was 45,XX,-15,-17,+der(17),t(15;17)(q13;p13.3) and thus combines abnormalities of chromosome 15 associated with the Prader-Willi syndrome and of chromosome 17 associated with the Miller-Dieker syndrome.  The Miller-Dieker syndrome (MDS), a rare congenital disorder manifested by characteristic facial abnormalities and lissencephaly (smooth brain), is associated with microdeletions of the distal 17p region.  A revision of the lissencephaly and Miller-Dieker syndrome critical regions in chromosome 17p13.3.Miller-Dieker syndrome (MDS) is a multiple malformation syndrome characterized by classical lissencephaly and a characteristic facies.  Case Report of Proliferative Peripheral Retinopathy in Two Familial Lissencephaly Infants with Miller-Dieker Syndrome.A complete ophthalmic examination is not routinely performed on infants with Miller-Dieker syndrome (MDS, chromosome 17p13.3 microdeletion).  Identification of the functional profilin gene, its localization to chromosome subband 17p13.3, and demonstration of its deletion in some patients with Miller-Dieker syndrome.Profilin is a conserved actin-monomer-binding protein which is found in all eukaryotes, including yeast.  We propose that essentially no loss of 17p material has occurred and confirm previous reports that the critical region for the production of the Miller-Dieker phenotype is located subterminally in the 17p13.3 region.<br> A review of the literature revealed five additional patients in three families, who had Miller-Dieker syndrome and an abnormality of 17p.

Facing a growing workload and dwindling resources, the US National Library of Medicine (NLM) created the Indexing Initiative project in 1996. This cross-library team's mission is to explore indexing methodologies for ensuring quality and currency of NLM document collections. The NLM Medical Text Indexer (MTI) is the main product of this project and has been providing automated indexing recommendations since 2002. After all of this time, the questions arise whether MTI is still useful and relevant.METHODS: To answer the question about MTI usefulness, we track a wide variety of statistics related to how frequently MEDLINE indexers refer to MTI recommendations, how well MTI performs against human indexing, and how often MTI is used. To answer the question of MTI relevancy compared to other available tools, we have participated in the 2013 and 2014 BioASQ Challenges. The BioASQ Challenges have provided us with an unbiased comparison between the MTI system and other systems performing the same task.RESULTS: Indexers have continually increased their use of MTI recommendations over the years from 15.75% of the articles they index in 2002 to 62.44% in 2014 showing that the indexers find MTI to be increasingly useful. The MTI performance statistics show significant improvement in Precision (+0.2992) and F1 (+0.1997) with modest gains in Recall (+0.0454) over the years. MTI consistency is comparable to the available indexer consistency studies. MTI performed well in both of the BioASQ Challenges ranking within the top tier teams.CONCLUSIONS: Based on our findings, yes, MTI is still relevant and useful, and needs to be improved and expanded. The BioASQ Challenge results have shown that we need to incorporate more machine learning into MTI while still retaining the indexing rules that have earned MTI the indexers' trust over the years.

CONCLUSIONS Intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin is a viable therapeutic option in patients with high risk superficial bladder cancer and concomitant lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia, treatment with low dose oral steroids or treatment with inhaled steroids. PURPOSE Bacillus Calmette-Guerin is the most effective therapy for nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer. INTRODUCTION Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) is a live attenuated strain of Mycobacterium bovis that has been used to treat urothelial carcinoma since 1976, and has been reported to eradicate disease in more than 70% of patients with in situ and stage I disease. Intravesical administration of bacillus Calmette-Guerin has been shown to be highly effective treatment of superficial bladder cancer. Intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin therapy for superficial bladder cancer: effect of bacillus Calmette-Guerin viability on treatment results. We describe a 53 year- old man with a disseminated bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) infection after intravescical instillation for bladder carcinoma. We tested the hypothesis that tumor expression of natural cytotoxicity receptor ligands can serve as a predictive factor for the response to intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin in patients with nonmuscle invasive, high grade bladder cancer. Bacillus Calmette-Guerin immunotherapy has been found by a number of investigators to be effective in the treatment and prevention of superficial bladder cancer. Pancreatic and psoas abscesses as a late complication of intravesical administration of bacillus Calmette-Guerin for bladder cancer: a case report and review of the literature.This case illustrates the fact that although intravesical administration of bacillus Calmette-Guerin is generally considered to be safe, it is not exempt from complications and these could appear immediately after treatment or as a delayed complication many years later.

Suicide attempts are accompanied by a willingness for death and can lead to suicide. They are more common in high-functioning autism and Asperger subjects.  A total sample of 10 adolescents and young adults diagnosed with AS was obtained. The high proportion of respondents with scores above the cutoff point on the overt victimization and relational victimization scales suggests that these adolescents and young adults experienced high levels of victimization. Of the sample, 20 percent met criteria for a diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder, 30 percent met criteria for Generalized Anxiety Disorder and 50 percent had clinically significant level of suicidal ideation.

This study suggests a potential neuroprotective role of hesperidin against 3-NP-induced Huntington's disease-like manifestations. Hesperidin potentiates the neuroprotective effects of diazepam and gabapentin against pentylenetetrazole-induced convulsions in mice: Possible behavioral, biochemical and mitochondrial alterations. Hesperidin, a flavanoglycone abundantly present in citrus fruits, is reported to have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective properties. PURPOSE Hesperidin, a glycoside flavonoid, is thought to act as an anti-cancer agent, since it has been found to exhibit both pro-apoptotic and anti-proliferative effects in several cancer cell types. Hesperidin is a flavonone glycoside, belonging to the flavonoid family, which is widely found in Citrus species and acts as a potent antioxidant and anticancer agent. BACKGROUND Hesperidin, a flavanone present in citrus fruits, has been identified as a potent anticancer agent because of its proapoptotic and antiproliferative characteristics in some tumor cells. Oxidative stress and cancer; the role of hesperidin, a citrus natural bioflavonoid, as a cancer chemoprotective agent. Our data suggests that hesperidin exerts its neuroprotective effect against rotenone due to its antioxidant, maintenance of mitochondrial function, and antiapoptotic properties in a neuroblastoma cell line. Taken together, these results demonstrate potent antioxidant and neuroprotective effects of hesperetin, implying its potential role in protecting neurons against various types of insults associated with many neurodegenerative diseases. The neuroprotective effect of hesperidin in NMDA-induced retinal injury acts by suppressing oxidative stress and excessive calpain activation.We found that hesperidin, a plant-derived bioflavonoid, may be a candidate agent for neuroprotective treatment in the retina, after screening 41 materials for anti-oxidative properties in a primary retinal cell culture under oxidative stress.

Intrinsically disordered proteins and regions are involved in a wide range of cellular functions, and they often facilitate protein-protein interactions. Molecular recognition features (MoRFs) are segments of intrinsically disordered regions that bind to partner proteins, where binding is concomitant with a transition to a structured conformation. MoRFs facilitate translation, transport, signaling, and regulatory processes and are found across all domains of life. A popular computational tool, MoRFpred, accurately predicts MoRFs in protein sequences. MoRFpred is implemented as a user-friendly web server that is freely available at http://biomine.cs.vcu.edu/servers/MoRFpred/ . We describe this predictor, explain how to run the web server, and show how to interpret the results it generates. We also demonstrate the utility of this web server based on two case studies, focusing on the relevance of evolutionary conservation of MoRF regions. MoRFPred-plus: Computational Identification of MoRFs in Protein Sequences using Physicochemical Properties and HMM profiles. Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDPs) lack stable tertiary structure and they actively participate in performing various biological functions. These IDPs expose short binding regions called Molecular Recognition Features (MoRFs) that permit interaction with structured protein regions. Upon interaction they undergo a disorder-to-order transition as a result of which their functionality arises. Predicting these MoRFs in disordered protein sequences is a challenging task.METHOD: In this study, we present MoRFpred-plus, an improved predictor over our previous proposed predictor to identify MoRFs in disordered protein sequences. Two separate independent propensity scores are computed via incorporating physicochemical properties and HMM profiles, these scores are combined to predict final MoRF propensity score for a given residue. The first score reflects the characteristics of a query residue to be part of MoRF region based on the composition and similarity of assumed MoRF and flank regions. The second score reflects the characteristics of a query residue to be part of MoRF region based on the properties of flanks associated around the given residue in the query protein sequence. The propensity scores are processed and common averaging is applied to generate the final prediction score of MoRFpred-plus.RESULTS: Performance of the proposed predictor is compared with available MoRF predictors, MoRFchibi, MoRFpred, and ANCHOR. Using previously collected training and test sets used to evaluate the mentioned predictors, the proposed predictor outperforms these predictors and generates lower false positive rate. In addition, MoRFpred-plus is a downloadable predictor, which makes it useful as it can be used as input to other computational tools. OPAL: prediction of MoRF regions in intrinsically disordered protein sequences. Intrinsically disordered proteins lack stable 3-dimensional structure and play a crucial role in performing various biological functions. Key to their biological function are the molecular recognition features (MoRFs) located within long disordered regions. Computationally identifying these MoRFs from disordered protein sequences is a challenging task. In this study, we present a new MoRF predictor, OPAL, to identify MoRFs in disordered protein sequences. OPAL utilizes two independent sources of information computed using different component predictors. The scores are processed and combined using common averaging method. The first score is computed using a component MoRF predictor which utilizes composition and sequence similarity of MoRF and non-MoRF regions to detect MoRFs. The second score is calculated using half-sphere exposure (HSE), solvent accessible surface area (ASA) and backbone angle information of the disordered protein sequence, using information from the amino acid properties of flanks surrounding the MoRFs to distinguish MoRF and non-MoRF residues.Results: OPAL is evaluated using test sets that were previously used to evaluate MoRF predictors, MoRFpred, MoRFchibi and MoRFchibi-web. The results demonstrate that OPAL outperforms all the available MoRF predictors and is the most accurate predictor available for MoRF prediction. It is available at http://www.alok-ai-lab.com/tools/opal/. OPAL+: Length-Specific MoRF Prediction in Intrinsically Disordered Protein Sequences. Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) contain long unstructured regions, which play an important role in their function. These intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) participate in binding events through regions called molecular recognition features (MoRFs). Computational prediction of MoRFs helps identify the potentially functional regions in IDRs. In this study, OPAL+, a novel MoRF predictor, is presented. OPAL+ uses separate models to predict MoRFs of varying lengths along with incorporating the hidden Markov model (HMM) profiles and physicochemical properties of MoRFs and their flanking regions. Together, these features help OPAL+ achieve a marginal performance improvement of 0.4-0.7% over its predecessor for diverse MoRF test sets. This performance improvement comes at the expense of increased run time as a result of the requirement of HMM profiles. OPAL+ is available for download at https://github.com/roneshsharma/OPAL-plus/wiki/OPAL-plus-Download. Computational Identification of MoRFs in Protein Sequences Using Hierarchical Application of Bayes Rule. Key to their regulatory function is often the binding to globular protein domains via sequence elements known as molecular recognition features (MoRFs). Development of computational tools for the identification of candidate MoRF locations in amino acid sequences is an important task and an area of growing interest. Given the relative sparseness of MoRFs in protein sequences, the accuracy of the available MoRF predictors is often inadequate for practical usage, which leaves a significant need and room for improvement. In this work, we introduce MoRFCHiBi_Web, which predicts MoRF locations in protein sequences with higher accuracy compared to current MoRF predictors.METHODS: Three distinct and largely independent property scores are computed with component predictors and then combined to generate the final MoRF propensity scores. The first score reflects the likelihood of sequence windows to harbour MoRFs and is based on amino acid composition and sequence similarity information. It is generated by MoRFCHiBi using small windows of up to 40 residues in size. The second score identifies long stretches of protein disorder and is generated by ESpritz with the DisProt option. Lastly, the third score reflects residue conservation and is assembled from PSSM files generated by PSI-BLAST. These propensity scores are processed and then hierarchically combined using Bayes rule to generate the final MoRFCHiBi_Web predictions.RESULTS: MoRFCHiBi_Web was tested on three datasets. Results show that MoRFCHiBi_Web outperforms previously developed predictors by generating less than half the false positive rate for the same true positive rate at practical threshold values. Computational identification of MoRFs in protein sequences. In this study, we introduce MoRFCHiBi, a new computational approach for fast and accurate prediction of MoRFs in protein sequences. MoRFCHiBi combines the outcomes of two support vector machine (SVM) models that take advantage of two different kernels with high noise tolerance. The first, SVMS, is designed to extract maximal information from the general contrast in amino acid compositions between MoRFs, their surrounding regions (Flanks), and the remainders of the sequences. The second, SVMT, is used to identify similarities between regions in a query sequence and MoRFs of the training set.RESULTS: We evaluated the performance of our predictor by comparing its results with those of two currently available MoRF predictors, MoRFpred and ANCHOR. Using three test sets that have previously been collected and used to evaluate MoRFpred and ANCHOR, we demonstrate that MoRFCHiBi outperforms the other predictors with respect to different evaluation metrics. In addition, MoRFCHiBi is downloadable and fast, which makes it useful as a component in other computational prediction tools.AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: http://www.chibi.ubc.ca/morf/.

In older children, sinusitis and otitis media are usually the source for subdural empyem Subdural empyema as a complication of sinusitis in the pediatric population. Second, subdural empyema appears to arise in the setting of subacute rather than acute frontal sinusitis. Subdural empyema is a rare but potentially life-threatening complication following paranasal sinusitis and should be considered as a neurological emergency. [Subdural empyema as a complication of sinusitis. INTRODUCTION Subdural empyema is an uncommon but serious complication of sinusitis. Intracranial subdural empyema is most frequently a complication of sinusitis or, less frequently, otitis or neurosurgical procedures. Subdural empyema is a rare complication of sinusitis although very severe. Subdural empyema is a rare complication of sinusitis in children. Subdural empyema is a rare but serious complication of paranasal sinusitis which may result in death or permanent disability in a significant proportion of cases. We report a case of subdural empyema secondary to frontal sinusitis in an otherwise healthy immunocompetent adolescent boy. Subdural empyema is a rare but life-threatening complication of paranasal sinusitis, otitis media, or mastoid disease.

Streptococcus pluranimalium: A novel human pathogen?<AbstractText Label=\"INTRODUCTION\" NlmCategory=\"BACKGROUND\">We present the first case of a subdural empyema caused by Streptococcus pluranimalium, in a healthy adolescent male as a possible complication of subclinical frontal sinusitis.  <AbstractText Label=\"DISCUSSION\" NlmCategory=\"CONCLUSIONS\">The diagnosis of subdural empyema as a complication of asymptomatic sinusitis in an immunocompetent patient with no history of fever or upper respiratory symptoms was unanticipated.  Second, subdural empyema appears to arise in the setting of subacute rather than acute frontal sinusitis.  Bifrontal decompressive craniectomy for acute subdural empyema.<AbstractText Label=\"INTRODUCTION\" NlmCategory=\"BACKGROUND\">Subdural empyema is an uncommon but serious complication of sinusitis.  Subdural empyema is a rare but potentially life-threatening complication following paranasal sinusitis and should be considered as a neurological emergency.  We present a patient with subdural empyema in whom the diagnosis was delayed, followed by a discussion of suppurative complications of sinusitis.  <AbstractText Label=\"CASE REPORT\" NlmCategory=\"METHODS\">We report an unusual case of sinusitis-associated acute subdural empyema in a 13-year-old patient, presenting in a catastrophic manner with acutely raised intracranial pressure.  The symptoms of subdural empyema may be mild and may be the same as those associated with sinusitis, or the infection may result in alteration of the level of consciousness and focal neurologic deficits. We report the clinical and radiological course of an adolescent with a subdural empyema secondary to sinusitis. We report two cases of subdural empyema secondary to sinusitis in persons without impaired immunity. Subdural empyema as a complication of sinusitis. Furthermore, subdural empyema usually is related to sinus infections, particularly those caused by Streptococcus milleri, an anaerobic organism.

Using the determined X-ray crystal structure of PIM1 complexed to the compound 1-R as a control, we discuss the importance of including the protein flexibility inherent in the ensemble docking protocol, for the accuracy of the structure prediction of the bound state.  Here, we describe the crystal structure of Pim1 in complex with a newly developed pyrido[4,3-d]pyrimidine-derivative inhibitor (SKI-O-068).

Our objective was to investigate the prognostic value of TAMs in gliomas using automated quantitative double immunofluorescence. This is the first study to use automated quantitative immunofluorescence to determine the prognostic impact of TAMs. Our results suggest that M2-like TAMs hold an unfavourable prognostic value in high-grade gliomas and may contribute to a pro-tumourigenic microenvironment. Our data revealed that the amount of especially CD204+ TAMs increases with malignancy grade. In grade III-IV, high CD204 expression was associated with shorter survival, while high IBA-1 intensity correlated with a longer survival. In grade IV, CD204 showed independent prognostic value when adjusting for clinical data and the methylation status of O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase.", "label": "yes"}
